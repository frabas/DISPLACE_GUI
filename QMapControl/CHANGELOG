- NEW: Ability to disable mouse wheel scroll zooming
- FIXED: fixed issue preventing drawing when zooming in or out in some scenarios
- FIXED: support for port numbers, other than port 80
- NEW: Dynamically change the pixmap image of a point already on a map

2010-09-15
- Whole project is now a dynamic linked library
- The project structure was updated caused by the dll approach
- Zooming in maps via mousewheel was added

2010-07-19
- Added new ArrowPoint which renders as an arrowhead at a specified (and updateable) heading, providing orientation information for a Point on the map.
- Made the map-center crosshairs optional via MapControl::showCrosshairs().
- Cleaned up CirclePoint code, and added antialiasing hints to the rendering of it and ArrowPoint.
- Added tile prefetching by default on Maemo 5 and Symbian targets. This may improve performance on those platforms, but no formal testing has yet been done.
- Slayed some compiler warnings and typos, as well as some miscellaneous bugs

0.9.5.2 (2009-07-29)
=====
- The new EmptyMapAdapter allows it to just display and navigate through an defined image and not to load map tiles. See new sample application.

2009-04-19
----------
- new class FixedImageOverlay for drawing an image overlay onto a map, whose upper left and lower 
  right corners lay always on the given coordinates. Inheritance is not perfect here: 
  the methods setBaselevel, setMaxsize and setMinsize have no effect for this class.

2009-02-28
-----------
- Fixed bug which didn't painted the zoomed image correct after the QMapControl widget was resized 

2008-10-28
----------
- New MapControl slot: resize(QSize) which resizes layers to the given size. So you can connect a widget's resize event to this slot. (See sample "Mapviewer").

2008-10-09
----------
- New MapControl-signal: viewChanged(coordinate, zoom) which emits the current center coordinate and zoom level after an view update (Thanks to Lorenzo)

2008-09-28
----------
- New layer-method clearGeometries() to remove all Geometry objects of a layer

0.9.5.1
=======
- Minor changes: limiting zoom not to exceed min and max borders
- showScale caused crash if zoom was out of range

0.9.5
=====
- new method "enablePersistentCache()" allows to store map tiles
- new method "showScale(bool)" allows to display the scale of the current map

0.9.4
=====
- removed "get" prefixes from ancessor functions, to improve Qt-like design
- renamed event "geometryClickEvent()" to "geometryClicked()"
- renamed event "draggedRect()" to "boxDragged()"
