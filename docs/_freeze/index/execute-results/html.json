Why such a model?\nTraditional fishery assessments often treat the ocean as a uniform backdrop, ignoring where vessels actually operate and how they react to closures, wind farms or other sea uses. DISPLACE fills that gap by coupling high resolution biological dynamics with individual vessel decision making in both time and space. This bi directional link is rare in the literature but essential for realistic impact assessmentseuropa.eu.\n\n# 2. Core components\nComponent\tWhat it does\tExample output\nFish stock module\tSimulates growth, recruitment and mortality of target species at a fine spatial grid.\tSeasonal biomass maps for cod, herring, etc.\nVessel behavior module\tEach vessel decides where, when and how much effort to apply, based on profitability, gear limits and regulatory constraints.\tEffort displacement routes when a Marine Protected Area is introduced.\nEconomic module\tCalculates revenues, costs, fuel use and profit margins for each fleet/metier.\tChanges in fleet income under different spatial scenarios.\nCross sector layer\tAllows inclusion of other sea uses—offshore wind, shipping lanes, aquaculture—to see how they compete for space.\tAssessment of effort loss when a wind farm array occupies a productive ground.\nAll modules run on a spatio temporal grid that can be tailored—from basin wide (North Sea, Baltic) to local (Northern Adriatic) scalesdisplace-project.org.\n\n# 3. What can DISPLACE tell us?\n1.\tEcological impact – predicts how closures affect stock biomass and fishing mortality.\n2.\tEconomic outcome – quantifies revenue shifts, fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions for each fleet.\n3.\tEffort displacement – visualises new routes vessels take when excluded zones appear, helping planners anticipate “leakage” effects.\n4.\tMulti sector trade offs – evaluates whether a wind farm placement harms fisheries more than it benefits renewable energy goals.\nThese outputs feed directly into Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) processes, giving policymakers evidence based options rather than guesswork.\n\n# 4. Real world applications\nDISPLACE has already been applied to several European seas—Adriatic, Ionian, Black, Baltic and Celtic—testing scenarios ranging from demersal stock protection to coexistence with offshore wind farms. In the northern Adriatic, the model helped identify spatial arrangements that protect high value demersal stocks while allowing sustainable fishing effort to persist.\n\n# 5. Take away\n1.\tDISPLACE bridges biology and economics at a granular spatial scale, something most legacy models lack.\n2.\tIt supports transparent, scenario based decision making, crucial for balancing food security, livelihoods and emerging marine industries.\n3.\tBy visualising effort displacement, it reveals hidden costs and opportunities that would otherwise remain invisible.\nIn short, DISPLACE equips us with a quantitative “what if” laboratory for the seas, enabling smarter, more resilient fisheries management in an increasingly crowded seascape\n\n# 7. California app\nUCSB used DISPLACE to evaluate the potential impacts of California’s Offshore Wind energy development lease areas on the DTS fisheries operating off the coast of California. This notebook summarizes the requirements, inputs, outputs, and processes for running DISPLACE and the associated R routines. Separate documentation about DISPLACE can be found on the [project website](https://displace-project.org/blog/).\n\nThis repository includes an application example based on this Californian study. It does not use actual vessel or fisheries data, but rather example data that do not reflect any confidential fishing information. This allows for a complete test run of the parametrization and model, and provides an opportunity to become familiar with the processes and different model components.\n\n## Working environment\n\nThe current project uses DISPLACE version 1.5.8 on Windows 11. You can download the installer [here](https://displace-project.org/blog/download/). The R routines run on R version 4.5.0 (on any platform or operating system). All required R packages are detailed in `r/config.R`.\n\nThe [repository](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb/DISPLACE_California) contains all the scripts required to prepare input data in the DISPLACE format, along with scripts for basic processing of outputs in the `r` and `routines` folders. It also includes example data in the `raw_inputs` folder, which serve as reference for data contents and structure when building a DISPLACE application.  \n\nThe `processed_inputs` folder is initially empty and is automatically populated when running the routines with `r/functions_routines.R`. To explore DISPLACE results, you will need to manually move the model output files into the `outputs` folder so they can be read by `r/functions_outputs.R`.\n\n```\nDISPLACE_California\n  |__ docs\n  |__ qmd\n  |__ raw_inputs\n  |__ processed_inputs\n  |__ outputs\n  |__ routines\n  |__ r\n```\n\n## Quick Setup & Run \n\nFor a quick execution and model run to test whether it can run on your machine, execute:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(here::here(\"r/functions_routines.R\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore executing, make sure to update the installer directory in the `directory` parameter of the `generate_dis_run_files` function in `functions_routines.R`. Running this script will populate the `processed_inputs` folder, whose contents then need to be moved to the machine where DISPLACE is run. This must be a Windows machine, and the inputs must be located in `C:/`. You should also create a folder named `DISPLACE_outputs` in `C:/`, where the outputs will be stored.  \n\nWe recommend reviewing the entire repository to understand the inputs and processes in more detail before executing.\n",
